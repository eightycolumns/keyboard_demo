# Keyboard Demo

  This is a demo of a keyboard instrument written in Csound.

  It's more or less in the tradition of the Yamaha DX series electric pianos.

## Prerequisites

  All you need is Docker... and your favorite headphones.

## Build Keyboard Demo

  Just run `./build_keyboard_demo`.

  That'll build a Docker image first. Then it'll use that image to build `keyboard_demo.wav`.
